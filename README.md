OpenTracing API for PHP
=======================

This package is an unofficial PHP platform API for OpenTracing.

## Required Reading

In order to understand the Go platform API, one must first be familiar with the
[OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/spec/) more generally.

## Status

Current version: API unstable

In the current version, opentracing-php provides only the API and a
basic no-op implementation that can be used by instrumentation libraries to
collect and propagate distributed tracing context.
